So for this on all I did was just read the code thorughly.  
I learnt a bit about hashlib, hexdigest, fernet and all to comprehend and try to understand what to do...  
So in the *check_code* function, we were given a bunch of indices which we had to extract from our sha256 hash objects converted to hex strings and that was the missing part of the flag.  
The flag is _picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_f911a486}_
