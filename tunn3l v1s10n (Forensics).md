So for this one I had no clue cuz the metafile I was opening was unreadable.  
Then I tried to change the file format like t zip files and all but that did not work either for me.  
After that I tried to change it into jpg format and to my surprise an image opened up that could lead me to the flag.

_The sorry not a flag sign did not discourage me to discontinue but I was actually doubtful about how to go about this challenge after I moved one step closer towards the answer._  
Although a part of me wondered that the image size is like 2.8MB it must be holding much more than it shows so I decided to give my old friend _hexed.it_ a visit  
But I absolutely failed to find anything that I needed.  
Frustrated enough I open up a writeup on this challenge _https://medium.com/@joao_amaral/pico-ctf-tunnel-vision-forensics-exercise-2e3ed2234b54_ just to take a small hint and from there I came to know about BMP file format!!
